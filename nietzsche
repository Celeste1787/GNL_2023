The will to truth that still seduces us into taking so many risks, this famous
truthfulness that all philosophers so far have talked about with veneration:
what questions this will to truth has already laid before us! What strange,
terrible, questionable questions! That is already a long story – and yet
it seems to have hardly begun? Is it any wonder if we finally become
suspicious, lose patience, turn impatiently away? That we ourselves are
also learning from this Sphinx to pose questions? Who is it really that
questions us here? What in us really wills the truth? In fact, we paused
for a long time before the question of the cause of this will – until we
finally came to a complete standstill in front of an even more fundamental
question. We asked about the value of this will. Granted, we will truth:
why not untruth instead? And uncertainty? Even ignorance? The problem
of the value of truth came before us, – or was it we who came before the
problem? Which of us is Oedipus? Which one is the Sphinx? It seems
we have a rendezvous of questions and question-marks. – And, believe it
or not, it ultimately looks to us as if the problem has never been raised
until now, – as if we were the first to ever see it, fix our gaze on it, risk it.
Because this involves risk and perhaps no risk has ever been greater.

covetous leer? Such origins are impossible, and people who dream about
